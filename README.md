changing individual state peices into contexts, and using useReducer for more complicated states
using native and 3rd party apis for timer picker, notifications, etc.
needed to change into more customized components (modal for example is not react native because it doesn't hide status bar properly)
alert was a massive pain, but got fixed with some alterations with contexts
